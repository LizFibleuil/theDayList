This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The domain name for this app is the-daylist.surge.sh (Hosted by Surge).

This project is meant to be a Desktop React App that generates workout routines for the user. The end result can then be printed to PDF or the routine can be reset to start from scratch. 

Some of the features that I would like to add in a future iteration are the following: 
    1. Provide Option to define superseed workouts
    2. Provide a way to define sets and add that extra time
    3. Provide a way to showcase that an exercise is either for the right or left limb. 
    4. Provide an option to create a randomize exercise routine created by the app.
